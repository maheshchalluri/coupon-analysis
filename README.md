üöó Customer Coupon Acceptance Analysis
This project explores the factors that influence whether drivers accept digital coupons while on the road. The goal was to uncover meaningful patterns that could help explain why some drivers choose to use these coupons‚Äîand why others don‚Äôt.

üìö Background
The dataset comes from a survey where participants were asked if they would accept a coupon (for restaurants, bars, coffee houses, etc.) sent to their phone during a driving scenario. Acceptance was defined as using the coupon either immediately or before it expired.

‚úÖ Overall Acceptance Trends
Roughly 57% of coupons in the dataset were accepted. While a majority said yes, a large portion of offers were still declined‚Äîsuggesting that coupon acceptance depends on more than just availability.

üîç Key Findings: What Sets Acceptors Apart?
We examined several factors, including the driver's habits, who was in the car with them, and the time of day. Here's what stood out for two major coupon categories:

üç∏ Bar Coupons
Frequent Bar-Goers Are More Receptive: Drivers who go to bars more than 3 times a month were far more likely to accept a bar coupon.

Age Plays a Role (Especially with Habits): Those over 25 who also visit bars regularly were more likely to say yes, showing that lifestyle and age work together.

Passenger Type & Occupation Matter: Drivers traveling with adults (not kids) and those in certain job sectors were more likely to accept bar coupons‚Äîpossibly reflecting more social or flexible lifestyles.

Best Predictors Are Combinations: The highest acceptance rates were seen in people who hit multiple criteria: over 25, frequent bar visits, no kids as passengers, eat at inexpensive restaurants often, and fall within specific income brackets.

‚òï Coffee House Coupons
Company Influences Decisions: Drivers with friends or partners in the car were more likely to accept a coffee coupon than those driving alone or with kids‚Äîhinting at the social nature of coffee outings.

Timing Is Key: Acceptance was highest at 10 AM and 2 PM‚Äîcommon times for coffee breaks.

Regular Visitors Say Yes More Often: People who already go to coffee shops regularly were more likely to take advantage of a coffee coupon.

Combining Factors Matters Here Too: The best acceptance rates were seen among drivers with companions, who regularly go to coffee shops, and received the coupon during morning or early afternoon hours.

üß† Conclusion
Drivers don‚Äôt accept coupons at random. Acceptance is closely tied to personal habits, social context, and timing. For bar coupons, those who already lead a ‚Äúbar-going‚Äù lifestyle are the most responsive. For coffee house offers, having company and getting the coupon during a typical coffee time makes a big difference.

In short: coupons work best when they align with what people are already likely to do. If businesses can target offers based on these traits, they may see much higher engagement and usage.
